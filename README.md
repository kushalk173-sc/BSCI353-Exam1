## Quiz Answer Key

1.  The **Neuron Doctrine**, championed by Santiago RamÃ³n y Cajal, posits that the nervous system is composed of **discrete, individual cells** called neurons. This contrasts with the **Reticular Theory**, which held that nerve cells were connected in a continuous, directly interconnected network or **reticulum**.
2.  The **resting membrane potential** is the voltage difference across a cell's membrane at rest, typically around **-65 mV** in neurons. It's largely established by **potassium (K+)** ions, as the membrane at rest is most permeable to K+, causing the potential to be close to the K+ equilibrium potential ($E_K$).
3.  **Ohm's Law** states that current is the product of voltage and conductance ($I = gV$). This means more current flows if conductance (more open ion channels) or voltage (driving force) is higher. Conductance is the inverse of resistance ($g = 1/R$).
4.  **Electrochemical equilibrium** is a state of balance where there's no net movement of an ion across the membrane. It's achieved when the **chemical gradient** (driving ions from high to low concentration) is perfectly opposed by the **electrical gradient** (voltage).
5.  Hodgkin and Huxley used the **voltage-clamp technique**. The **squid giant axon** was an ideal model because its massive size made it possible to insert the electrodes needed to control ("clamp") the membrane voltage and measure the resulting ionic currents. 
6.  During the **rising phase** (depolarization), voltage-gated **Na+ channels** open rapidly, causing a Na+ influx that drives the membrane potential up. During the **falling phase** (repolarization), the Na+ channels **inactivate**, and slower-opening voltage-gated **K+ channels** allow K+ to flow out, bringing the potential back down.
7.  **Na+ channel inactivation** is a process where the channel becomes non-conductive, even while the membrane is depolarized. This creates a **refractory period** behind the action potential, ensuring it can only travel in one direction down the axon.
8.  **Myelin** acts as an electrical insulator, dramatically increasing the axon's membrane resistance. This prevents ion leakage and forces the electrical current to travel farther and faster down the axon's interior to the next **node of Ranvier**, where the signal is regenerated.
9.  In a **voltage-clamp**, the experimenter *controls the voltage* and *measures the current* needed to maintain it, which reveals how ion channel conductance changes. In a **current-clamp**, the experimenter *controls the current* injected and *measures the resulting voltage changes*, which is used to study phenomena like the action potential.
10. The three main types are **astrocytes**, **oligodendrocytes**, and **microglial cells**.
    * **Astrocytes**: Maintain the chemical environment for neurons.
    * **Oligodendrocytes**: Form the myelin sheath around axons in the CNS.
    * **Microglial cells**: Act as the brain's immune cells, cleaning up debris.

## Essay Questions

1.  Trace the complete sequence of an action potential from threshold to after-hyperpolarization. Detail the precise behavior of voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels (activation, inactivation, deactivation) and how these changes in ionic conductances shape the waveform.
2.  Compare and contrast the Golgi stain, immunolabeling, and genetic labeling (e.g., GFP). For each, describe what it labels and the unique insights it provides into neuronal structure, diversity, and connectivity.
3.  Using the Goldman Equation, explain why a neuron's resting membrane potential is close to, but not identical to, the potassium equilibrium potential. Then, describe how the transient shift in permeability from potassium to sodium underlies the action potential's rapid depolarization.
4.  Describe the biophysical mechanisms for ion selectivity and voltage sensitivity in ion channels. How does a potassium channel's "selectivity filter" exclude smaller Na+ ions? What part of a voltage-gated channel acts as the "voltage sensor"?
5.  Explain how the diversity of ion channels contributes to different neuronal firing patterns. Discuss how channels like "A-type" K+ channels or "inward rectifying" K+ channels can alter a neuron's response to synaptic input.
