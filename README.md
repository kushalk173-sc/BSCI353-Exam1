Quiz Answer Key
 * The Neuron Doctrine, championed by Santiago Ramón y Cajal, posits that the nervous system is composed of discrete, individual cells called neurons, which are the fundamental structural and functional units. This contrasts with the Reticular Theory, which held that nerve cells were connected in a continuous, directly interconnected protoplasmic network or reticulum.
 * The resting membrane potential is the difference in voltage between the inside and the outside of a cell at rest, typically around -65 mV in neurons. In a typical mammalian neuron, this potential is largely established by potassium (K+) ions, as the membrane at rest is most permeable to K+, causing the potential to be close to the K+ equilibrium potential (E_K).
 * Ohm's Law states that current is the product of voltage and conductance (I = gV). This means that for a given voltage, more current will flow if the conductance is higher (e.g., more open ion channels), and for a given conductance, more current will flow if the voltage (driving force) is greater. Conductance is the inverse of resistance (g = 1/R).
 * Electrochemical equilibrium is a state where there is no net movement of an ion across the cell membrane. It represents a balance between two opposing forces: the chemical gradient (diffusion), which drives ions from an area of high concentration to low concentration, and the electrical gradient (voltage), which moves ions based on their charge.
 * Hodgkin and Huxley used the voltage-clamp technique to study voltage-dependent permeability. The squid giant axon was an ideal model because its large size made it possible to insert electrodes to both measure the intracellular voltage and inject the current necessary to hold, or "clamp," the membrane potential at a desired level while measuring the resulting ionic currents.
 * During the rising phase (depolarization), voltage-gated Na+ channels open rapidly, leading to a massive influx of Na+ ions that drives the membrane potential toward the Na+ equilibrium potential (E_{Na}). During the falling phase (repolarization), the Na+ channels inactivate, and the slower-to-open voltage-gated K+ channels become fully permeable, allowing K+ ions to flow out of the cell and bring the membrane potential back down.
 * Na+ channel inactivation is a process, distinct from closing, where the channel becomes non-conductive even if the membrane is depolarized. This process is crucial for unidirectional propagation because it creates a refractory period behind the advancing action potential, preventing it from reversing direction by ensuring that the channels it just passed are temporarily unable to reopen.
 * Myelin is a lipid-rich wrapping that dramatically increases the membrane resistance of the axon, reducing the amount of ionic current that can "leak" out across the membrane. This forces the current to flow farther down the axon's interior, speeding up the passive spread of depolarization to the next node of Ranvier, where the voltage-gated channels are concentrated.
 * In a voltage-clamp recording, the experimenter controls the membrane voltage and holds it at a fixed level, while measuring the ionic current required to maintain that voltage; this allows for the study of how conductance changes with voltage. In a current-clamp recording, the experimenter controls the current injected into the cell and measures the resulting changes in membrane voltage, which is used to study phenomena like the action potential.
 * The three main types are astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglial cells.
   * Astrocytes help maintain an appropriate chemical environment for neuronal signaling.
   * Oligodendrocytes lay down the myelin sheath around axons in the CNS to speed up signal transmission.
   * Microglial cells act as scavengers, removing cellular debris from sites of injury or normal cell turnover.
Essay Questions
 * Trace the complete sequence of events that constitutes a single action potential, beginning from the integration of inputs that brings a neuron to threshold. Your explanation should detail the precise, time-dependent behavior of voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels (including activation, inactivation, and deactivation), the resulting changes in ionic conductances, and how these factors shape the distinct phases of the action potential waveform (depolarization, repolarization, and after-hyperpolarization).
 * Compare and contrast the three major methods for visualizing neurons and their components: the Golgi stain, immunolabeling, and genetic labeling (e.g., using GFP). For each method, describe what it labels and explain the unique insights it provides into neuronal structure, diversity, and connectivity.
 * Using the principles of the Goldman Equation, explain why the resting membrane potential of a neuron is primarily determined by potassium permeability but is not identical to the potassium equilibrium potential. Furthermore, describe how the massive, transient shift in relative permeability from potassium to sodium underlies the rapid depolarization phase of the action potential.
 * Describe the biophysical mechanisms that confer ion selectivity and voltage sensitivity to ion channels. How does the structure of the "selectivity filter" in a potassium channel allow it to pass K+ ions while excluding smaller Na+ ions? What part of a voltage-gated channel acts as the "voltage sensor" that triggers the channel to open in response to depolarization?
 * Explain how the properties of ion channels contribute to the diversity of neuronal firing patterns. Discuss how variations in channel types, such as the presence of inactivating "A-type" K+ channels or "inward rectifying" K+ channels, can alter a neuron's response to synaptic input and its ability to fire action potentials.
